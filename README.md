# Alice and Lam

This Git repository is collaborative work by two fictive developers named Alice and Lam.
The repository's content is not meaningful,
its whole purpose is to provide a deterministic commit history
so that the [`score-and-rank-contributors`](https://github.com/asterinas/score-and-rank-contributors) tool
can use it for the testing purpose.
